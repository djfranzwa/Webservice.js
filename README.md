Webservice.js
=============

A simple Web service wrapper library.

I got kind of tired relying on JQuery all the time to make any HTTP requests using JavaScript. I decided to build this tiny, simple JavaScript library which can be used to call Web services using HTTP GET or HTTP POST.

It probably sucks, but it works. :D
